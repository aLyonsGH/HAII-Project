## Resources

- For learning about how to fine tune with Huggingface, we looked at this tutorial: https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-python
- For learning about web functionality (ex. How to make buttons, drop-down selections, etc) we adapted examples generated by ChatGPT
- For finding a dataset, we used this database: https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Fhatespeechdata.com%2F
